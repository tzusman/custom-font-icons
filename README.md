# Crowd commissioned font icon set
A publicly released icon font set commissioned by the crowd.  These icons go perfectly with the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icon set.

## Would you like to see more icons in here?

#### Yes! I would like to contribute my own icons
Great, thank you for helping improve this project. Here are the instructions on how to add your own icons:

Adding new icons is exceptionally easy.  Add the icon in svg format to the `src/svg` folder.  These svgs must be generated as described in [these docs](https://github.com/nfroidure/gulp-iconfont#preparing-svgs). Run `npm start` to generate the build folder.  As items are added or updated, th files.  Submit a PR to the [custom-font-icons repo](https://github.com/tzusman/custom-font-icons), and you're done!

For convenience, running `npm start` will continue to watch the `src/svg` folder.  As .svg files are added, updated, or removed, the build script will automatically run.

#### Yes! I would like to commission icons
This would be great too! The designer who created the icons that are currently in the set will create 10 icons for $150.  I can discuss with him if he'd lower his rate if there are at least 25 icons involved.  Any commissioned icons will be released under the MIT license in this project.

*if you absolutely need designed icons to be private, double the price and I will allocate the extra cost towards the commission of the most community voted on icons.*

#### Yes! I would like someone to design them for free
Can't blame you. Although this is not going to be a very effective choice, feel free to submit an issue and add the label `icon`. Maybe a nice person will heed your request.
