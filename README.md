# Crowd commissioned font icon set
A publicly released icon font set commissioned by the crowd.  These icons go perfectly with the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icon set.

## Would you like to see more icons in here?

#### Yes! I would like to contribute my own icons
Great, thank you for helping improve this project. Simply create a PR with the updated build files (run `gulp build`).

#### Yes! I would like to commission icons
This would be great too! The designer who created the icons that are currently in the set will create 10 icons for $150.  I can discuss with him if he'd lower his rate if there are at least 25 icons involved.  Any commissioned icons will be released under the MIT license in this project.

*if you absolutely need designed icons to be private, double the price and I will allocate the extra cost towards the commission of the most community voted on icons.*

#### Yes! I would like someone to design them for free
Can't blame you. Although this is not going to be a very effective choice, feel free to submit an issue and add the label `icon`. Maybe a nice person will heed your request.
